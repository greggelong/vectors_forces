### Some p5js code with comments made while following Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code

 

Back to bouncing balls and obsessing about my weight. 
If my objects are not in an array, I always name them after myself and a loved one. 
The big yellow ball object is named after me.  I am more massive than MJ. 
So let's talk about my weight. Weight is force, which is  equal to mass multiplied by gravitational acceleration. I remember dreaming as an overweight child to visit the moon and at the same time loose weight. Or calculating your weight on other planets. But here just trying to simulate Newtonian physics using p5js vectors, and physics concepts of position, velocity and acceleration, mass and force.  
I am following #danielshiffman Nature of Code simulating forces  and mass in his processing book and his new #p5js videos.  
I also found Georgia State University physics teaching website hyperPhysics really helpful for understanding the basic concepts.http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mass.html
